    "### 1. Maximizing Profit (15 points)\n",
    "#### A furniture company produces three types of couches. The first type uses $1$ foot of framing wood and $3$ feet of cabinet wood. The second type uses $2$ feet of framing wood and $2$ feet of cabinet wood. The third type uses $2$ feet of framing wood and $1$ foot of cabinet wood. The profit of the three types of couches is $10$ dollar,  $8$ dollar , and $5$ dolalr, respectively. The factory produces $500$ couches each month of the first type,$300$ of the second type, and $200$ of the third type. However, this month there is a shortage of cabinet wood to only $600$ feet, but the supply of framing wood is increased by $100$ feet. How should the production of the three types of couches be adjusted to minimize the decrease in profit? Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem."
